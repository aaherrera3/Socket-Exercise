# Socket-Exercise
Write a simple Server/Client program where client types in "what time is it?" and the server returns the current local time. Terminated when the client types "Goodbye".


To run the program you need to terminals. One will run the client and the other one will run the server.
You need to run the server side first otherwise the client will crash as it has nothing to connect to.
Once you run the server then the client you are now ready to give input to the system.
What time is it?, will return the date andd time.
Goodbye, will close the server and the client.
Anything else, will return "Sorry I dont understand".
